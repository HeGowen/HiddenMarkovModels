# HiddenMarkovModels
discrete/continuous hiddenStates/emissions

This project implements the following algorithms:
1. Discrete Hidden Markov Model:
  Training with mutiple-observations
  Evaluate the probability of a given observation sequence
  Find the hidden states given an observation
  
2. Hidden Markov Model for continous observations

3. Add Gaussian Mixture Model as Emission Functions
